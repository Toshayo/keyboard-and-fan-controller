# Keyboard & Fan Controller
Small application to control RGB keyboard animation mode,
speed, color and direction.

The app can also toggle fans to auto, turbo and manual modes.
In manual mode each fan can be controlled separately.

Works only with my [driver](https://github.com/Toshayo/acer-nitro17-keyboard-and-fan-driver).
